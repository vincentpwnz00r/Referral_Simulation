# Referral_Simulation

The code is broken down into 7 classes. Each of the referral method is being put into a class. The classes SingleSided.java, DoubleSided.java, Recursive.java, Shapley.java contains the referral methods single sided, double sided, recursive and Shapley value respectively. IncentiveNode.java class contains of the constructor and methods that is required for the construction of the referral tree. Probability.java class contains the random number generator and decision methods that is required for simulating the decision of the users. Runner.java class contains of the main methods that is used to run the simulation and produce calculations for each incentive earned by the users and the author.

In order to run the desired situation,the probability threshold of the price, incentive amount and referral types needs to be set in the Runner.java class. This can be chosen by setting the variables priceThreshold, incentiveThreshold, typeThreshold respectively. The results will be produced and displayed on the console.
